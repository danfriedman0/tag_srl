# tag_srl: Semantic Role Labeling with Tree-adjoining Grammars

This is an SRL model based on the syntax-agnostic model of Marcheggiani et al (2017). See https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02593 and https://github.com/diegma/neural-dep-srl. We use TAG supertags in addition to part of speech tags.

You need your own copy of the CoNLL-2009 dataset to run the model.
